KNOWN BUGS

Dypgen does not handle cyclic grammars : when a non terminal can derive itself.
And it does not warn the user that its grammar is cyclic. The behavior is
not defined.

When there is an error of type with the arguments or the result of a merge
function, Caml reports it and points to the .ml file generated by dypgen,
not to the .dyp input file, which may be puzzling.
